I am a driven, innovative and creative Contact Center architect known for my respected results, entrepreneurial ideas, focused insights and strong relationships.

I am passionate about customer service and building solutions which exceed expectations through impactful interactions and consistent attention to detail. I learned early that if you make life easier for your customer, they will make your life easier too.

_Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains._

_ **         &#8211; Steve Jobs**_

I lead highly engaged teams with trust, mutual respect, customer focus and an investment in professional development.

My experience within many facets of Contact Center technologies including Genesys, Avaya & Operations including QA, Workforce Management has established a solid track record of setting ambitious goals and energetically tackling them with a focus on adding value through superior execution.

I co-founded &#8216;FlexiContact Ltd&#8217; with offices in UK and India to provide services in Contact Center field. You can contact me through my linkedin profile below
